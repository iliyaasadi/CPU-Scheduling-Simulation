# Process Scheduler Simulation

This project implements and tests three CPU scheduling algorithms: **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF, non-preemptive)**, and **Round Robin (RR)**. The code simulates process scheduling, calculates performance metrics (average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time), and visualizes the execution order using Gantt charts.

## Project Structure

- **scheduler.h**: Defines the `Process` and `Metrics` structures and function prototypes for the scheduling algorithms.
- **scheduler.c**: Implements the FCFS, SJF, and RR scheduling algorithms, including Gantt chart output and metric calculations.
- **scheduler_test.c**: Contains test cases to validate the scheduling algorithms against expected metrics.
- **Makefile**: Automates compilation and execution of the test program.

## Prerequisites

- **GCC**: A C compiler to build the project.
- **Make**: To use the provided Makefile for compilation and execution.
- **Linux/Unix-like environment** or any system with GCC and Make installed.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Clone or download the project** to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

3. **Compile the project** using the Makefile:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This generates the executable `scheduler_test`.

4. **Run the tests**:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

5. **Clean up** (remove the executable):

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Input

The scheduling algorithms operate on an array of `Process` structures, each containing:

- `pid`: Process ID.
- `arrivalTime`: Time when the process arrives.
- `burstTime`: CPU time required to complete the process.
- `remainingTime`: Used by RR to track remaining execution time.
- `startTime`: Time when the process first starts (for response time).
- `completionTime`: Time when the process finishes.

The `scheduler_test.c` file defines eight test cases with varying numbers of processes, arrival times, burst times, and time quanta for RR. For example:

- **Test Case 1**: Three processes with arrival times 0, 1, 2 and burst times 10, 5, 8, with a quantum of 4 for RR.
- **Test Case 5**: A single process (edge case) with arrival time 0 and burst time 5.

The RR algorithm requires a `timeQuantum` parameter, which varies per test case (e.g., 2, 3, or 4).

## Output

The program outputs:

1. **Gantt Charts**: Visual representations of process execution order for each algorithm, showing process IDs and their start/end times.
   - Format: `| P<process_id> (start-end) | ... |`
   - Example (Test Case 1, FCFS): `| P1 (0-10) | P2 (10-15) | P3 (15-23) |`
2. **Metrics**: For each algorithm (FCFS, SJF, RR), the program calculates:
   - **Average Turnaround Time**: Time from arrival to completion.
   - **Average Waiting Time**: Time spent waiting in the ready queue.
   - **Average Response Time**: Time from arrival to first execution.
   - Example (Test Case 1, FCFS): `Turnaround: 15.00, Waiting: 7.33, Response: 7.33`
3. **Test Results**: Compares calculated metrics against expected values with a tolerance of 0.1. Each test case prints "PASSED" if all metrics match.

## Sample Output

The following sections provide sample outputs for each scheduling algorithm (FCFS, SJF, and RR) across multiple test cases, including Gantt charts and calculated metrics (average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time). Each test case demonstrates the performance of the algorithms under different process configurations.

- **RR**: Turnaround: 20.67, Waiting: 14.83, Response: 6.33


## Notes

- **FCFS**: Processes are executed in the order of their arrival times. Itâ€™s simple but may lead to longer waiting times for short processes.
- **SJF (Non-preemptive)**: Selects the process with the shortest burst time among those that have arrived, minimizing waiting time but requiring knowledge of burst times.
- **RR**: Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum). It ensures fairness and lower response times but may increase turnaround time due to context switching.
- The test cases cover various scenarios, including single processes, simultaneous arrivals, and idle CPU periods.
- The program assumes valid input (non-negative arrival and burst times, positive quantum).

## Limitations

- The SJF implementation is non-preemptive, meaning a running process cannot be interrupted.
- The program does not handle dynamic process input outside the test cases.
- Metrics are compared with a fixed tolerance (0.1) to account for floating-point inaccuracies.

## Extending the Project

To extend this project, you could:

- Add preemptive SJF or Priority Scheduling algorithms.
- Support dynamic process input via a file or user interface.
- Visualize Gantt charts graphically using a library like SDL or a plotting tool.
- Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative burst times).
